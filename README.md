# CSC2611Lab

This repo includes the code for the lab of CSC2611 2023 Fall.

Usage:
1. download the word2vec embeddings to the root path as described in Step 1 of the handout.
2. install all necessary python packages. They are: `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `tqdm`, `scipy`, `gensim`, `nltk` and `scikit-learn`.
3. run assignment.py. 

For referencing or quick inspecting, `example_output.out` and `semantic_change_figure.png` contains all the output from the python module. The result in the two files should be identical to the output of running `python3 assignment.py > example_output.out`.
